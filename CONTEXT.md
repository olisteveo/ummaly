# Ummaly â€“ Halal Lifestyle Mobile App

## Problem Statement

Muslims around the world often lack access to a reliable, centralised digital solution that helps them find halal food, products, and services. Existing tools are outdated, fragmented, or incomplete. This gap leaves users struggling to navigate halal compliance confidently in daily life.

- Look up halal-certified restaurants by location
- Scan food and product barcodes for halal status (first 5 scans are free)
- Access personalised prayer times based on geolocation
- View Islamic blog content
- Browse community events
- Submit or flag halal data for moderation
- Subscribe for full features via Stripe integration

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart), developed in Android Studio
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), developed in VS Code
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (scalable, read-optimised)
- **Subscriptions**: Stripe API integration
- **Geolocation**: Google Maps API
